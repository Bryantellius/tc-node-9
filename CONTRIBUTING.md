## Pull Requests

Github has a _pull request_ feature that allows users to request that other users pull in their contributions to a project. Pull requests are a very common way that developers contribute to other projects.

### How to Submit a Pull Request

Start by forking and cloning a project on Github. Once you have made local changes and pushed up a new commit, do the following:

1. Find the green **Code** button on your Github page of the project you just pushed to
2. Below that button will be a dropdown titled **Contribute**
3. Click the single single green **Open pull request** button
4. From this new page, find the green **Create pull request** button
5. The following view will allow you to change or add an additional pull request message
6. When ready, submit the pull request by clicking the green **Create pull request** button

And there you go! The owner of the repository will be able to view, comment on, and accept your changes if they see fit to do so.

## Assignments

### First

For your first contribution, start by creating a folder, labeled by your _github username_, under the `answers/` directory (ex: `answers/Bryantellius`).

Complete the following:

1. Create the following file under your newly created folder: `git.csv`
2. Add as many git commands with descriptions that you can. Reference the [Git Handbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) if desired.
3. Only add _one_ command/description pair per line, seperating each command and description by a comma. Preferably do not add a title or any other text to the file.

If you need a reference for a started answer, view [answers/Bryantellius/git.csv](/answers/Bryantellius/git.csv).

Be sure to add, commit and push your work back to Github. Once your work is on Github, [submit a pull request](#how-to-submit-a-pull-request).

### Second

For your second contribution, start the your folder labeled by your _github username_ under the `answers/` directory (ex: `answers/Bryantellius`).

Complete the following:

1. Create the following file under your newly created folder: `fact.txt`
2. Add a fact to this file that you don't think any other student would add as well. Use [answers/Bryantellius/fact.txt](answers/Bryantellius/fact.txt) as a reference
    - You fact can literally be anything (albeit appropriate). Make sure it is unique.

Be sure to add, commit and push your work back to Github. Once your work is on Github, [submit a pull request](#how-to-submit-a-pull-request).

## Notes

If you take notes during class or outside reading, add them to the `notes/` directory under a sub-folder labeled by the _topic_, followed by a file labeled by your _github username_ (ex: `notes/git/Bryantellius.md`).
