Crystals are magnificently repeating three-dimensional arrangements of atoms, 
ions, and molecules. Their inner structures are complex and intricately 
patterned. The oldest known pieces of our planet's surface are comprised of 
4.4-billion-year-old zircon crystals from the Jack Hills of western 
Australia. 

In crystallography, crystal systems that have space groups assigned to a 
common lattice system are combined into a crystal family. The seven crystal
systems are: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal,
hexagonal, and cubic.

In Chihuahua, Mexico, a limestone cavern 1,000 feet below the surface contains 
the largest crystals in the world: glittering gypsum formations up to 6 feet 
in diameter and 36 feet long, weighing as much as 55 tons. The streets of 
New York might not be paved with gold, but the schist beneath them is studded 
with opal, beryl, chrysoberyl, garnet, and three different kinds of tourmaline. 
Manhattan was built, quite literally, upon a bedrock of jewels.

The Cullinan stones, all flawless, are now part of the British Regalia.
The largest, a 530-carat behemoth, is set in one of the British royal 
scepters. 

Arguably the most famous precious gemstone in history, the Hope Diamond is
also reputed to be the most accursed. This hefty, 45.52-carat sparkler
has been blamed for a laundry list of tragedies, including but not limited 
to: beatings, stabbings, murder, insanity, and suicide. In fact, King Louis 
XVI and Marie Antoinette owned the fancy blue diamond during the French
Revolution -- and their beheadings. 

The last person to privately own the diamond was an American socialite 
named Evalyn McLean. Her daughter died of an overdose, her son died in a 
car crash, and her husband left her for another woman. The trustees of her estate 
sold the diamond to Harry Winston, who eventually donated it to the Smithsonian,
where it remains to this day, on permanent display for all to enjoy -- from a safe, 
comfortable distance.
